Assumptions:
-> We are defining a structure named "queue" which contains two variables which points to the front and rear end of the queue. 
   An array is defined of type pid which will hold the process ID of each of the process created.
-> We are calling sleep function for 1 second to ensure that the memory is freed only after all the threads complete their execution.
-> In the file "xsh_prodcons.c", we are initializing the front and rear ends of all the future queues to 0.
